# Fifth_Week_Project
An app for managing personal budgets made with ruby, psql and sinatra


Programming and Web Fundamentals: MoneyApp Project.

This is my first full project. We had a week to build an app to satisfy a set of criteria. My app, Budget:Board, allows a user to track short-term budgets and see their spending by category and vendor. They can then wipe the board with an easy click and start again.



Getting Started

Clone the project to your machine. Set up a database in psql with the command # createdb monies # followed by #psql -d monies -f monies.sql# and finally #ruby db/seeds.rb# to seed the database.
Next simple run the app.rb and go to your browswer and enter http://localhost:4567/ to see my app in action.


Prerequisites

You will need ruby, psql, sinatra and a web browser such as chrome.




Built With

Sinatra - The web framework used
PSQL - To set up and monitor the database
